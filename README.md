# Lazy

This project has the purpose to have a similar implementation depending on the language used.
It can be from `Javascript`, `Java`, `Kotlin`, `PHP` and even `C#`.

_(Maybe other languages will be added, we will see)_

## Publication location

This project only has the Javascript (with Typescript) uploaded.

But other languages will be eventually added
